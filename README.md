#### What is Credit Card Fraud Detection?
Nowadays most people prefer to do payments by cards and don’t like to carry cash with them. That leads to an increase in the use of cards and also thereby frauds.

Credit card frauds are easy to do, as we know that E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, Which affects increasing the risk of online frauds.

Credit card fraud is becoming the most common fraud people tend to do. So in this article by ProjectGurukul we are going to detect credit card fraud using Machine Learning.

#### About Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:
We need to find anomalies in the system for the companies that have a lot of transactions with the use of cards.

The project aims to build a credit card fraud detection model, which tells us if the transaction made by the card is fraud or not. So basically we will use the transaction and their labels as fraud or non-fraud to detect if the new transaction made by the customer is fraud or not.

To prevent customers from being charged for the items they did not purchase, It is important for credit card companies to recognize fraudulent credit card transactions.

#### Required Libraries for ML Credit Card Fraud Detection Project:
To create a “Credit card fraud detection project” you need to install some libraries in your system. The libraries are:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Sklearn
You can install it using pip, open your command prompt and type:

pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn sklearn

#### Steps that we follow to create this Project is:
- We will perform exploratory data analysis on our dataset,
- After making the dataset ready we will create a model using Machine Learning Algorithm. We are going to use the Logistic Regression method to detect credit card frauds.
- At last, we will Train and Evaluate our Logistic Regression model.

#### About Logistic Regression:
Logistic regression is a type of Supervised learning technique. It is the most popular Machine Learning algorithm, which is used to predict the probability of target variables. Logistic regression predicts the output of a categorical dependent variable which means there would be only two possible classes.

This is one of the simplest Machine Learning algorithms used for various classification problems such as spam detection, cancer detection etc.
